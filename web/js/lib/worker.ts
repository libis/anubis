/**
 * createWorkerSpawner fetches the worker source _once_ and hands back a

 * instead of making each worker fetch the worker code individually.
 *
 * Doing it this way prevents a single client with many threads fetching
 * the same worker source code n times for values that are fixed for the
 * entire lifetime of the deployment of Anubis at that version. The old
 * method made a client with 8 threads fetch the worker logic 8 times,
 * which made an overloaded server even more overloaded, causing spurious
 * failures, which cause challenges to fail 100% of the time. This is
 * bad for uptime.
 *
 * Annoyingly, `new Worker(url)` reports a load failure as an opaque event
 * that does not include the status code of the failed load, so there's
 * no real way to detect "503, back off and retry" from "404, you fetched
 * the wrong asset". To work around this we have to `fetch()` the contents
 * of the worker code and spawn it with a Blob.
 *
 * If anything goes wrong or the server's Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
 * forbids putting worker sources in Blobs, we fall back to the old behaviour
 * with the caveat that doing this is kinda hacky and terrible, but such is
 * life.
